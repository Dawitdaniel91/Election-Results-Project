#Election-Audit Summary:

As an American citizen, election is one of important practice for the implication of policies in the country. So that analizing the election data is one of the major proctics after election by citizen. i sugest some of my experiance to the election commisssion how the election script can be used with some modification. one is need to avoind form the script some money repetation script which makes confusion while writing the the writing the code such as on step one ,sptep two, and step seven , the other one is  some of the script not easly undrastable for example step 6d telling you about print current county,it perenctage of total votes, and its total votes to the comdand line.Becouse it looks like there is another county.
